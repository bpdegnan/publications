This directory contains the data for the paper "Low-power, serial interface for power-constrained devices", which is here: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7282105/

Unlike much of my work that includes netlists, the 14nm agreement means that I cannot give specific information; however, the graphs in the paper can all be generated by using MATLAB for the correct .m file.

I use this serial architecture everywhere I need SPI and it has shown to be very robust for systems with variable VDD.
